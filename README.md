AWS CLOUD practionar: ps

Cloud computing models:
IAAS: infrastructure as a service. absolute control. They are servers in cloud. Similar to how we would set servers in our own datacenter. Can change OS, completely config them. However we have to do maintenance of them.
SAAS: software as a service: email provider could be a SAAS service we are using them everyday. Donâ€™t have to config them, it is a service provided as you need.
PaaS: platform as a service, this is in middle of them both.
